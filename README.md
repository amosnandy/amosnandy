- 👋 Hi, I’m @amosnandy
- 👀  I’m deeply interested in exploring the frontiers of SEO automation. 
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in the automation scripts and tools that can enhance efficiency and accuracy. I'm particularly keen on learning about scripts, excells or any other automated sheet, machine learning models, and any API integrations that support SEO work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with like-minded individuals and teams who are passionate about transforming SEO practices through automation. Whether it's sharing knowledge, developing new scripts, or refining existing processes, I believe in the power of collaboration to push boundaries.
- 📫 Feel free to connect with me here on GitHub
